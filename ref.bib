In particular, for the case of massless neutrinos for which vacuum oscillations cannot occur, oscillations can occur in matter if the neutral current has an off-diagonal piece connecting different neutrino types. Applications discussed are solar neutrinos and a proposed experiment involving transmission of neutrinos through 1000 km of rock.},

@article{Castellani1996,
abstract = {After a short survey of the physics of solar neutrinos, giving an overview of hydrogen burning reactions, predictions of standard solar models and results of solar neutrino experiments, we discuss the solar-model-independent indications in favour of non-standard neutrino properties. The experimental results look to be in contradiction with each other, even disregarding some experiment: unless electron neutrinos disappear in their trip from the sun to the earth, the fluxes of intermediate energy neutrinos (those from 7Be electron capture and from the CNO cycle) result to be unphysically negative, or anyway extremely reduced with respect to standard solar model predictions. Next we review extensively non-standard solar models built as attempts to solve the solar neutrino puzzle. The dependence of the central solar temperature on chemical composition, opacity, age and on the values of the astrophysical S-factors for hydrogen-burning reactions is carefully investigated. Also, possible modifications of the branching among the various pp-chains in view of nuclear physics uncertainties are examined. Assuming standard neutrinos, all solar models examined fail in reconciling theory with experiments, even when the physical and chemical inputs are radically changed with respect to present knowledge and even if some of the experimental results are discarded.},

@article{Smirnov2003,
abstract = {The MSW (Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein) effect is the effect of transformation of one neutrino species (flavor) into another one in a medium with varying density. Three basic elements of the effect include: the refraction of neutrinos in matter, the resonance (level crossing) and the adiabaticity. The key notion is {\{}$\backslash$it the neutrino eigenstates{\}} in matter. Physical picture of the effect is described in terms of the flavors and the relative phases of eigenstates and the transitions between eigenstates. Features of the large mixing realization of the MSW effect are discussed. The large mixing MSW effect (LMA) provides the solution of the solar neutrino problem. We show in details how this mechanism works. Physics beyond the LMA solution is discussed. The lower {\$}Ar{\$}-production rate (in comparison with the LMA prediction) and absence of significant "turn up" of the spectrum at low energies can be due to an additional effect of the light sterile neutrino with very small mixing.},

@phdthesis{Keil2003,
abstract = {We study the flavor-dependent neutrino spectra formation in the core of a supernova (SN) by means of Monte Carlo simulations. A high-statistics neutrino signal from a galactic SN may contain information that severely constrains the parameter space for neutrino oscillations. Therefore, reliable predictions for flavor-dependent fluxes and spectra are urgently needed. In all traditional hydrodynamic simulations the nu{\_}mu,tau and nu{\_}mu,tau-bar interactions commonly included are rather schematic. With our Monte Carlo simulations we find that the most relevant sources for nu{\_}mu,tau and nu{\_}mu,tau-bar are traditionally not included. In comparing our numerical results for all flavors we find the standard hierarchy of mean energies nu{\_}e < nu{\_}e-bar < nu{\_}mu,tau, with, however, very similar values for nu{\_}mu,tau and nu{\_}e-bar. The luminosities of nu{\_}mu,tau and nu{\_}mu,tau-bar can differ by up to a factor of 2 from L{\_}nue-bar and L{\_}nue, the latter two are very similar. The Garching Group obtains similar results from their self-consistent simulation with the full set of interactions. These results are almost orthogonal to the previous standard picture of exactly equal luminosities of all flavors and differences in mean energies of up to a factor of 2. Existing concepts for identifying oscillation effects in a SN neutrino signal need to be revised. We present two methods for detecting the earth-matter effect that are rather independent of predictions from SN simulations.},
